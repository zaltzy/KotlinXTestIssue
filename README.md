# A template repository for a mobile shared library

An up-to-date project setup with the latest gradle configuration for bootstrapping an iOS & Android mobile shared library project.

## Features Compared to IDEA's New Project Template

- Uses Kotlin build gradle
- Has an iOS device and simulator targets
- iOS test runner works without booting the sim first
- iOS test runner is only setup and hooked into the `check` task on mac hosts

## Feature Requests

If there's a Kotlin mpp build setup you're trying to figure out or work through, please file a feature request GH issue!
